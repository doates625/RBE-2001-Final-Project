INTRODUCTION

This repo contains the C++ code and report for my RBE-2001 final project at WPI. As part of a group of 4, I helped design a robot which navigates a small model nuclear power plant and refuels reactors from storage and supply depots using information given over Bluetooth. While I participated in most of the design process, my focus in the group was software design. I wrote 100% of the project-specific software for the robot, which included state machine design, sensor interfacing, and multilayered PID control systems.

DEMONSTRATION

Here is a video of the robot in action:

ORGANIZATION

This repo is divided into two folders:

- Code: Contains all project-specific C++ code used in the robot.
- Report: Contains my group's final report.

DEPENDENCIES

This project utilized some of my general purpose Arduino libraries found at <https://github.com/doates625/ArduinoLibs>.

NOTE

This project was not originally developed on Github. It was migrated to github for organization, backup, and ease of access by anyone interested in knowing more about the project.
