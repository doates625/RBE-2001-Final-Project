INTRODUCTION

This repo contains the C++ code and report for my RBE-2001 Final project at WPI. As part of a group of 4, I helped design a robot which navigates a small model nuclear power plant and refuels reactors from storage and supply depots using information given over Bluetooth. While I participated in most of the design process, my focus in the group was software design. I wrote 100% of the project-specific software for the robot, which included state machine design, sensor interfacing, and multilayered PID control systems.

ORGANIZATION

This repo is divided into two folders:

- Code: Contains all project-specific C++ code used in the robot.
- Report: Contains my group's final report.

NOTE

This project was not originally developed on Github. It was migrated to github for organization, backup, and ease of access by anyone interested in knowing more about the project.
