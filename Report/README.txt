INTRODUCTION

This folder contains the final report submitted by my team.

REPORT ERRORS

It should be noted that my other team members didn't finish their report sections until 5AM before the 8AM deadline, so I was not given an opportunity to proofread their sections for correctness, organization, or cleanliness. There are a few errors in section organization and naming in the table of contents:

1. Appendix A: Work Contributions is not included in the tabe of contents (TOC). As a result, appendices A/B/C in the TOC are actually named B/C/D in the body of the report.

2. The "Field Navigation" and "State Machine Design" sections should not have been sub-sections of "Control Systems", rather their own sections.

MY SECTIONS

Below are the sections I contributed. The names are as they appear in the body (not the TOC, as discussed above).

Section Title		Pg	To
----------------------------------
Code Organization	 2	 3
Control Systems		 8	11
Field Navigation	11	12
State Machine Design	12	14
Appendix D: Code	18	65
